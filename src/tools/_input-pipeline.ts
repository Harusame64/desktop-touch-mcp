/**
 * ADR-018 destination-explicit input pipeline — Phase 1b dispatcher skeleton.
 *
 * Resolves an `InputDestination` (4-discriminator union per ADR §2.3) and
 * dispatches scroll wheel actions through the appropriate tier. Phase 1b
 * implements Tier 1 (UIA `IUIAutomationScrollPattern::SetScrollPercent` via
 * the new napi export `uiaScrollByWheelAtHwnd`); Tier 2 (CDP) lands in
 * Phase 3, Tier 3 (PostMessage WM_MOUSEWHEEL) in Phase 4. Tier 4 (legacy
 * nutjs SendInput) remains in `mouse.ts:scrollHandler` and is invoked by
 * the caller when `dispatchScrollWheel` returns `null` (Phase 1b fall-through
 * path; Phase 4 tightens this to `dest.kind === 'unresolved'` only when
 * Tier 3 PostMessage covers resolved-but-non-UIA destinations).
 *
 * See `docs/adr-018-phase-1b-subplan.md` for the Phase 1b interpretation of
 * §2.6.2 path-(b) (lenient Tier 4 guard during 1b → strict in Phase 4).
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §3.1 (multi-table fact integrity): the `reason` values emitted
 * here mirror the `reason?:` union of `ScrollVerifyOutcome` in
 * `src/tools/mouse.ts` and `docs/adr-018-input-pipeline-3tier.md` §2.6.2.
 * The `Channel` type below is the ADR §2.6.1 canonical 4-value enum that the
 * *dispatcher* emits via `DispatchOutcome.channel` (Phase 1b emits only
 * `'uia'`). NOTE: `mouse.ts:scrollHandler` additionally emits the legacy
 * literal `'wheel_send_input'` for its Tier 4 nutjs path — that literal is
 * scrollHandler-local and is folded into this `Channel` enum as `'send_input'`
 * by the Phase 4 §2.6.3 migration. Any rename must sweep all surfaces.

 *   2. **Plain-windowTitle Case 3 recovery**: `resolveWindowTarget` returns
 *      `null` for a plain `windowTitle` that DOES match a top-level window
 *      (`_resolve-window.ts` Case 3 discards the matched HWND by design, to
 *      keep legacy title-based callers unchanged). The dispatcher still needs
 *      that HWND so Tier 1 UIA is reachable for the common windowTitle-only
 *      scroll call (ADR §4 Phase 1 G1 acceptance — otherwise
 *      `scroll(windowTitle:'メモ帳')` could never report `channel:'uia'`). We
 *      re-run an `enumWindowsInZOrder` lookup here with Case 3's predicate
 *      (non-dialog class, no owner window) plus a minimized-window exclusion
 *      (a minimized HWND is not a usable dispatch/observation target) to
 *      recover it → `{ kind: 'hwnd' }`. This is still title-based, not
 *      cursor/foreground.
 *   3. No resolvable target → `{ kind: 'unresolved' }` so the caller falls
 *      through to Tier 4 SendInput (legacy nutjs in Phase 1b). This preserves
 *      the cursor-only / no-destination happy path (`scroll({action:'raw',
 *      direction:'down'})` with no windowTitle).
 *
 * **Dispatcher routing never touches cursor coordinates** — the cursor-pixel
 * routing that ADR-018 §1.2 identified as the root cause of the 11 reported
 * symptoms is confined to Tier 4 (which only fires when the destination is
 * unresolved, or when Tier 3 PostMessage is exhausted in Phase 4).
 *
 * Callers that need a *snapshot* HWND for Win32 GetScrollInfo observation
 * compute that separately — see `mouse.ts:scrollHandler`, which seeds the
 * observation HWND from `dest.hwnd` whenever `dest.kind === 'hwnd'` so
 * observation and action share the same destination (ADR §2.2 invariant).
