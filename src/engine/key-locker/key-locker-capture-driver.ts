// ADR-014 v2 R3 Key Locker — L3-4 W-2 (REDO): the capture DRIVER (the live-wiring CRUX).
//
// Plan: desktop-touch-mcp-internal:docs/adr-014-v2-r3-l3-4-live-wiring-plan.md (§0-CORR, §2.2, §3)
//
// Every L3 pipeline module is merged, pure, and unit-tested in ISOLATION, but NOTHING wires them into a
// running loop. This driver is that first production owner — the orchestration that turns the terminal's
// dispatch/prompt events into "the locker learns and fills credentials", while honoring the three
// atomicity obligations the pure `ssh-session-watch.ts` header pinned as WIRING responsibilities (W1/W2/W3).
//
// ⚠ FIRE-AFTER-DELIVERY (§0-CORR — SUPERSEDES the fire-before design of PR #513): the merged W-1 (#511)
// fires the S-A dispatch hook ONLY on a CONFIRMED-successful delivery (`terminal.ts:903-913` send /
// `:2137-2145` run). So when `onDispatch(paneId, command)` fires, the command has ALREADY been delivered and
// is running, and a fast interactive-ssh child CAN ALREADY be in the process tree. Three structural
// consequences vs the old fire-before design:
//   (A) `onDispatch` is FULLY SYNCHRONOUS (OQ-W-13 fold). The old `await deriveBinding` inside the handler
//       produced the entire await-window bug class (push→register race, late correlation, stale-arm-during-
//       derive/read). With the sync fold the handler runs atomically — no interleaving — so `dispatchSeq` +
//       clear-at-start + the token gate all COLLAPSE and are DELETED. Arm on a CHEAP synchronous pre-filter
//       (`looksLikeCredential` = `programOf(first real token of any segment) ∈ {sudo,doas,ssh,su}`, a generous
//       superset) and let the poll's capture loop run the AUTHORITATIVE `deriveBinding` it already runs. A
//       generous pre-filter only OVER-polls (bounded-safe, OQ-W-3), never wrong-targets.
//   (B) The W-2b scan must EXEMPT the assistant's OWN just-dispatched ssh (§0-CORR.2): with the child already
//       visible, the reconcile's W-2b unregistered-ssh scan would classify the assistant's own `ssh host-a`
//       as a lurking USER ssh → markUnknown → the assistant's own login never arms. The driver proves the
//       exact child pid THIS dispatch spawned via a before/after `sshBaseline` delta (host-matched to the
//       dispatched host) and passes `watch.tick({ paneId, pid, startTimeMs })` to skip exactly it. A user's
//       SAME-host ssh is a DIFFERENT pid ⇒ still flags; ambiguous (>1) or unprovable (0) ⇒ NO exempt.
//   (C) The loop admits a real `onDispatch` ONLY in its POST-LANDED window (§0-CORR.3, `loopPhase`): during
//       the pre-landed window the shell is BLOCKED at the credential prompt, so a delivered command has NOT
//       run — recording it would put the tracker ahead of reality. This REPLACES the old command-match /
//       `inRunToExit` gates (both admitted the pre-auth window).
//
// It stays ENGINE-PURE over injected seams (no Win32 / host / terminal import) so the whole wrong-target
// story is unit-testable with a fake process tree; the thin IMPURE composition root (W-4,
// `key-locker-wiring.ts`) binds these seams to the real terminal hooks + Win32 and drives the timers. It
// OWNS a live `SessionTracker` + `SshSessionWatch` (constructed by the manager, W-3) — passed in so tests
// drive the REAL reconciliation against a controllable snapshot.
//
// The events it services (all per-pane, keyed by `paneId = String(hwnd)` decimal — the same key the
// terminal, inject-target, and ssh-watch all emit, so tracker keys / InjectTarget hwnd / shellPid stay
// consistent BY CONSTRUCTION):
//   * onLocalPaneLaunched — W1 anchor: a pane L3 ITSELF launched from a known-local shell is anchored
//     KNOWN-LOCAL + watched, in ONE synchronous turn. A pre-existing pane is never anchored → stays UNKNOWN
//     → every fill declines (P1-B: anchoring on "no ssh child seen" would false-anchor a plink/mosh/renamed-
//     ssh pane local and disclose a LOCAL secret to a REMOTE prompt).
//   * onDispatch — the S-A dispatch hook. Fully SYNCHRONOUS: (0) drop if pre-landed; (1) correlate stragglers
//     + compute the W-2b exempt pid via the sshBaseline delta + RECONCILE (`watch.tick(exempt)`); (2) FREEZE
//     `tracker.get(paneId)` as the pre-effect frame the capture loop derives from; (3) record the session
//     effect (derive-then-record) + register the proven ssh child; (4) arm the poller on the cheap pre-filter.
//   * poll — the prompt poller (the wiring drives it on a timer). On a credential prompt, runs
//     `runCaptureLoop` bound to the FROZEN session. Single-flight per pane (P2-E); sets `loopPhase`.
//   * onPaneClosed — W2 close atomicity: `unwatchPane` paired same-turn with `tracker.forget`.
