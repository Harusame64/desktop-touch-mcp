// ADR-014 v2 R3 Key Locker — L1: ssh host-key fingerprint resolution (OQ-1 = A).

// Resolve an ssh alias to its EFFECTIVE (user, host, port) via `ssh -G` — passing the invocation's
// own options THROUGH (a command-line `-p 2222` / `-l user` / `-F altconfig` / `-o …` / a config
// `HostKeyAlias` all change the endpoint; `ssh -G alias` alone would resolve the WRONG one) — then
// read the host's stored key fingerprints from the known_hosts files ssh itself would consult
// (user `UserKnownHostsFile` + `GlobalKnownHostsFile`, each possibly multiple paths; absent files
// are skipped as EMPTY, never as failure). The fingerprint SET becomes part of the canonical key:
// if the recorded host identity drifts, the key differs, the store misses, and nothing autofills.
//
// `ssh -G` prints the effective config WITHOUT connecting; `ssh-keygen -l -F` handles hashed
// known_hosts entries and prints one SHA256 fingerprint per stored key type. We never parse
// ~/.ssh/config ourselves. Read-only, no network, no secret at this layer.
