// ADR-014 v2 R3 Key Locker — L3 §3 / §6: the ssh session-end watch (SP-L3-OQ-7).
//
// Plan: desktop-touch-mcp-internal:docs/adr-014-v2-r3-l3-3-manager-watch-plan.md (PR 3) +
//   adr-014-v2-r3-l3-capture-plan.md §3 (the ssh-out pop signal).
//
// WHY: an interactive `ssh user@host` runs under Mode B (a pane read), NOT an exit-mode watch — so the
// SessionTracker frame it pushed has no exit code to pop on. If it is never popped, a later LOCAL command
// in that pane derives `sudo://<remotehost>` and, on a MATCH, would autofill the REMOTE secret into a
// LOCAL prompt — a wrong-target fill. The authoritative session-end signal is the SESSION's `ssh` CHILD
// PROCESS exiting, observed via the process tree (a process observation, never a screen-scrape).
//
// WHAT IT WATCHES (Opus L3-3 PR#505 R1 P2-A): the tracker pushes a frame ONLY for an INTERACTIVE ssh —
// a backgrounded `ssh -f -L`, a one-shot `ssh host cmd`, and a ProxyJump/`-W` child ssh push NO frame yet
// are ALSO `ssh` processes under the shell. So the watch must NOT react to "any ssh descendant exiting"
// (a dying tunnel would pop a still-live interactive frame → the pane mislabels remote-as-local → the
// INVERSE wrong-target). Instead the wiring, which dispatched the interactive ssh and can correlate the
// child it spawned, REGISTERS that specific pid via `noteSshOpened`; the watch fires only when THAT pid
// exits. Only the OUTERMOST ssh is locally visible (an inner `ssh b` runs ON host-a).
//
// STRUCTURAL AXIS (Opus/Codex PR#505 R2–R5, folded from five rounds of wrong-target edges): the watch can
// reliably observe EXACTLY ONE thing — the single depth-1 outer ssh, ALIVE, readable as `ssh`, with a
// NON-ZERO creation time matching the registered baseline. It TRUSTS only that one state; a session-bearing
// pane is observable/trustable ONLY at EXACTLY `remoteDepth === 1`, and EVERY other state declines. So, for
// a pane with a registered session: depth 1 + confirmed-same → KEEP; depth 1 + confirmed-exit → POP; depth 1
// + unconfirmable identity (unreadable "" / zero creation time) → SINK; **depth ≥ 2 (nested) → ALWAYS SINK**
// (the inner login runs on the remote host, unobservable locally, so it can never be popped); **depth 0 +
// LIVE registered ssh → SINK** (the tracker was re-anchored local while the ssh lives — trusting local would
// wrong-target); **depth 0 + GONE pid → DROP the stale watch, KEEP local** (a benign re-anchor race, the
// local anchor is legitimate). Nesting AND the depth invariant are enforced at `tick` (and nesting also at
// registration) so the watch self-enforces rather than trusting wiring discipline.
//
// This module is PURE reconciliation over an injected process snapshot — no Win32 import — so it
// unit-tests with a fake tree. The KeyLockerManager (the live wiring, deferred) owns the instance: it
// snapshots via win32 `buildProcessParentMap()` + `getProcessIdentityByPid()` (mapping `processName`
// LOWERCASED into `ProcessIdentity.name`), registers the shell pid + the session ssh pid, and drives
// `tick()` on a timer. That live wiring lands with the terminal-event subscription.
//
// FAIL-SAFE (§3, Opus/Codex R2–R5 P2): any doubt sinks the pane to `markUnknown` (decline-to-derive), NEVER
// a stale trusted `isRemote:true` and NEVER a pop-to-local on a live session. Doubt sources: (a) an
// unwatchable pane (its shell pid vanished); (b) NESTED ssh (`remoteDepth ≥ 2`) — the invisible inner login
// is unobservable, so a nested pane is declined outright (R4); (c) a registered session ssh PRESENT but
// UNREADABLE this tick — identify() reads "" for a live pid (R2) OR `startTimeMs === 0` for a live ssh whose
// creation-time read failed (win32 reads name/time independently — R4); (d) a remote frame with NO live
// watch — a registration that could not confirm a live `ssh`, or the non-atomic push↔register window (R3:
// `noteSshOpened` sink + the `tick` backstop); (e) `remoteDepth === 0` with a LIVE registered ssh — the
// tracker was re-anchored local while the ssh lives, so trusting local would wrong-target (R5).
//
// INVARIANTS the watch relies on (breaking either breaks the watch): (1) `SessionTracker.recordDispatch`
// pushes `isRemote:true` ONLY for `program === "ssh"`, so EVERY remote frame is an ssh frame and the
// `name === "ssh"` trust is sound; (2) `session.startedAt` is never 0 (registration forbids it). RECOVERY:
// `markUnknown` sets the tracker stack to null and does NOT auto-recover on the session's later exit —
// `recordDispatch` early-returns on a null stack — so an unknown pane re-anchors only when the wiring calls
// `beginLocalSession` at a fresh local prompt (SP-L3-OQ-8 territory), not via exit observation. Safe
// (declines), just degraded longer. RESIDUAL (P3, plan §Risks): the shell anchor is liveness-only
// (`!parentMap.has(shellPid)`) with no startTime check — a reused shell pid can mask shell death; it
// self-heals (the dead shell's ssh child dies/reparents ⇒ the session check catches it) and is tracked in
// the plan, not gated on.
