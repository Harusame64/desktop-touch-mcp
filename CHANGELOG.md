# Changelog

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added (Auto Perception)
- **Auto guard for action tools**: `mouse_click`, `mouse_drag`, `keyboard_type`,
  `keyboard_press`, `click_element`, `set_element_value`, `browser_click_element`,
  `browser_navigate` now auto-guard using `windowTitle` / `tabId` / `port`
  without requiring `perception_register`.
- `post.perception` is now attached on both success **and failure** responses so
  LLMs can recover from guard blocks without taking another screenshot.
- **HotTargetCache**: hidden short-term target cache (6 slots, idle TTL 90s, hard
  TTL 10 min, bad TTL 15s) for repeated actions on the same window/tab.
  Improves guard performance on consecutive actions; does not consume manual lens
  budget (16 slots).
- **SuggestedFix + `mouse_click({ fixId })`**: one-shot recovery approval when a
  guard detects recoverable coordinate drift or identity change. `fixId` TTL is
  15s. The server revalidates the target fingerprint before executing.
- Environment variable `DESKTOP_TOUCH_AUTO_GUARD=0` to disable all auto-guard
  behavior and revert to v0.11.12 semantics.

### Fixed
- **`mouse_click` guard now evaluates the FINAL click coordinate** (after
  `origin`/`scale` conversion and homing), not the stale input coordinate.
  Previously the guard could silently pass a click whose final screen coordinate
  was outside the lens rect. Manual `lensId` users may see new `GuardFailed`
  errors for cases that were previously silently passing — this is intentional;
  verify the click is actually where you intend.

### Changed
- Tool descriptions for 8 action tools now prefer `windowTitle`/`tabId`
  arguments over explicit `lensId`. `perception_register` is now advertised
  as an advanced/debug API.
- `post.perception` type widened to `PerceptionEnvelope | AutoGuardEnvelope`
  (discriminated by `kind`: `"manual"` vs `"auto"`).

### Compatibility
- Existing `lensId`-based workflows continue to work unchanged.
- `perception_register` / `perception_read` / `perception_forget` /
  `perception_list` API is unchanged.
- `DESKTOP_TOUCH_AUTO_GUARD=0` restores v0.11.12 behavior exactly.
